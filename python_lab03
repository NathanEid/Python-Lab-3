Task02
A Queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed.
The order is First In First Out (FIFO). A good example of a queue is any queue of consumers for a
resource where the consumer that came first is served first.
1 - We need to implement a python class that represents the queue data
structure.
The class should have these operations:
- insert(value) => which inserts a new value at the rear of the queue
- pop() => which returns and removes a value from the front of the queue.
We should return None and print a warning message if we tried to pop
value from an empty queue
- is_empty() => which returns True or False to represent whether the queue
is empty or not
